# Proxyfier
Project to automatically enable specific proxy with optional username/password based on currently connected SSID.

Currently wanting to rewrite using only the original bat creation in order change the proxy. 

The BatchFile, Network SSID, DusokayTrayIcon, and other non-GUI classes can be imported as is. The rest must be rewritten 
to use a main class that handles accessing a sqlite db of all proxies/usernames. 


Will be uploading a class diagram of the DB once time permits.
